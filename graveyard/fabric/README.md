LLM prompt organizer/facilitator.

CLI tool could be cool, but I haven't done much with it. A couple hours into trying to get a GUI for browsing the prompts lead me to give up on whatever they have and treat the prompts as more (generic) knowledge that should be searchable and useable like the rest of any personal notes etc.
